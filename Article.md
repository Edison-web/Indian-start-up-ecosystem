# Insight Into The Indian Startup Ecosystem

## Introduction:

Asia is proving to be the leading continent in a booming business, technology, and science. In view of this many businesses are focusing on getting business establishments there or have an affiliation with an already existing industry there. 

In this article, we will focus on the Indian eco-system and see which sector(s) are doing well and receiving great funding*. The key steps taken are documented in this article:

•	Hypothesis

•	Data understanding

•	Data cleaning

•	Data analysis and visualization

## Hypothesis

For this project, my hypothesis is:

### Null hypothesis:

Fintech is the most lucrative sector receiving the most significant funding in the Indian startup ecosys-tem.

### Alternate hypothesis:

Fintech is not the most lucrative sector as it is not receiving the most significant amount of funding in the Indian startup ecosystem

## Data understanding

The datasets are provided as ‘CSV’ files. There were four (4) datasets in all -one for each year (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021).

After previewing the datasets, it was noted that:

i.	The 2018 dataset had fewer columns than the other datasets (i.e 2019, 2020, 2021).

ii.	The column names of the 2018 dataset are not consistent with that of the other datasets.

iii. Most of the amounts of the 2018 dataset were in Indian rupees while the amounts of the 2019 to 2021 datasets are in dollars.

iv.	Some figures in the amount columns were undisclosed, range (e.g 8800000 – 150000000).

v.	In some instances, names of funding companies and seed stages, were found under the amount column.

## Questions

After reviewing the data, some questions are posed to help reach a better conclusion

1. Which sector received the most funding from 2018 to 2021?

2. How much funding has the fintech sector received in the Indian startup ecosystem over the same period, compared to other sectors?

3. Have there been any significant fintech funding deals in the Indian startup ecosystem from 2018 to 2021?

4. What are the top 10 sectors that had the most funding over the same period?

5. How many fintech start-up companies received funding from 2018 to 2021 compared to other companies in the top 10 sectors?

6. How does the average amount of funding received by fintech startups compare to the average amount of funding received by start-ups in other sectors in the Indian startup ecosystem over the same period?

7. Have the investment trends in the Indian startup ecosystem shown a preference for fintech companies over other sectors from 2018 to 2021?
